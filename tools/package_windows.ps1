.SYNOPSIS
    Assemble a Windows release zip from a finished build tree.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Windows counterpart of tools/package_linux.sh, and deliberately the same shape. The
    payload is listed by name rather than copied with a wildcard, so a release that quietly lost
    decomp-recipes/ fails here instead of on a stranger's machine. Nothing is written until
    check_windows_deps.py confirms the executables need no DLL beside them, which is what tells
    the static build tree apart from the dynamic one.

.EXAMPLE
    pwsh tools/package_windows.ps1 -BuildDir build/x64 -Version 1.0.1
