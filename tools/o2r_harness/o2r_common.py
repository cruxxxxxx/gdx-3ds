# "total central-directory records"). record_count() below computes the same thing
# (len(z.infolist())). The current
# deterministic archive has NO duplicate records, so records == unique names; the historical
# 4240-records / 664-duplicates / 3576-unique split described the pre-2026-07-18 archive (Windows
# double-emit bug) and no longer applies after the Torch parity fix.

# 3610 = 3608 prior census + 2 rsp_blob families (aspmain_text, aspmain_data; 2026-08-08). The
# RSP microcode moved out of the source tree (it is Nintendo-copyrighted) into the
# locally-generated archive; strictly additive, no existing payload touched.

# segment_blob families (common_assets_compressed, kanji_tables, rom_boot_tuning -- W-R4.S1
# census). The base 3576 includes the portVersion entry, which Torch only emits when gdx-extract
# is run with `-u <version>` (the runtime passes `-u 2027490995`, the US-rev0 ROM CRC 0x78D90EB3).
# The gauntlet MUST pass the same `-u` or it will mint a golden that is one record short and whose
# SHA-256 will not match the runtime archive.
#
# The +4 comes from the create_machine_textures re-slice in port/gen/AssetBindings.c: four slots
# that had been reading a neighbour's bytes were given symbols of their own (D_4002F40_2640,
# D_4003180, D_40033C0, D_4003600) and the four around them were repointed at their correct
# segment offsets. Blessed only after checking the shape of the change: the new archive is a
# strict SUPERSET of the old one -- 4 records added, 0 removed, 0 payloads altered, each new
# record a real 656-byte texture rather than the blank a half-populated family would produce.
