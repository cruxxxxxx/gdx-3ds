/* port/disk_savefile.h -- durable 64DD disk-save sidecar (copy-on-write dirty-LBA journal).
 *
 * The port's 64DD "drive" is a linear disk image loaded into gdx_disk_buffer
 * (port/disk_buffer.cpp). Game writes (Course Edit saves, MFS RAM-area formats,
 * ghost autosaves that land on disk) update that in-memory image; this module
 * makes them durable WITHOUT ever mutating the user's pristine .ndd, by recording
 * only the dirty byte ranges into a sidecar next to the executable
 * ("saves/<diskFileName>.gdd") and replaying them at the next boot.
 *
 * Design: copy-on-write journal. The pristine .ndd is the immutable base; the
 * sidecar is a coalesced list of {byteOffset, length, data} records covering
 * exactly the ranges the game has written since the base was authored. A
 * CRC64 fingerprint of the pristine image is stored in the sidecar header so a
 * sidecar is NEVER applied to a disk it was not created against.
 *
 * Host-CRT translation unit (G-Diffuser executable target, like port/sram_buffer.cpp
 * and port/gdx_ghost_io.c), so the standard file API is available here. The decomp
 * game object library never sees fopen/FILE; it reaches the two decomp-facing entry
 * points (gdx_disk_save_mark_dirty from port/n64_leo.c's write path, and the format
 * guard below) through raw C externs, the same boundary idiom sram_buffer.cpp uses.
