// G-Diffuser — runtime O2R asset extraction launcher.
//
// Produces (or refreshes) <dataDir>/generic.o2r from the cartridge ROM by spawning the packaged
// `gdx-extract` child against the shipped `decomp-recipes` tree. An installed/packaged build has NO
// generic.o2r until this runs.
//
// Invariants:
//   * ROM SHA-1 is validated BEFORE the child is spawned (expected hash from
//     decomp-recipes/config.yml).
//   * Nothing installs before it validates: exit code, zip entry count, archive SHA-256, version
//     entry — then an atomic temp->rename with a Windows sharing-violation retry loop.
//   * Complete-or-absent: extraction NEVER blocks boot. On any failure the temp is deleted, any
//     previous archive is preserved, and the raw-ROM fallback carries the session.
//   * State model: completion sidecar gdx_extract_state.cfg + warm-boot skip.
//   * Called from main.cpp before the archive mount list is built; progress UX is a Win32 modeless
//     dialog on Windows and log-only on Linux.
//
// Part of the G-Diffuser exe target (not the decomp game library), so it may freely use the host CRT,
// <filesystem>, and (Windows) the Win32 process + common-controls APIs. It runs before libultraship
// is constructed, so it logs through the port's own gdx_port_logf and touches no LUS state.
