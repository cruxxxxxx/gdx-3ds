/**
 * @file port/enhancements/tuning/BoostDuration.cpp
 * @brief Enhancement: override how many frames a boost lasts. First consumer of the
 *        port/enhancements event layer, and the reference example for writing another.
 *
 * Changes a gameplay value that lives inside the matching decompilation with no decomp diff of its
 * own. Its whole contract with the rest of the program is a file-scope static initialiser handing
 * GameEvents_AddInstaller a callback, plus one entry in port/CMakeLists.txt's
 * add_executable(G-Diffuser ...) list. Copy that pattern for a new enhancement; see
 * port/enhancements/events/GameEvents.h for why the event bus exists at all.
 *
 * CVAR
 * ----
 *   gEnhancements.Tuning.BoostDuration  (int, default 0)
 *     0 or below -> stock behaviour; the listener writes nothing at all.
 *     n > 0      -> a boost lasts n frames instead of the stock 100 (decomp/src/game/racer.c:387).
 *
 * Deliberately NO menu UI: set it from LUS's console (`set gEnhancements.Tuning.BoostDuration
 * 300`) or the CVar config file. A slider in port/gdx_menu.cpp is a separate follow-up.
 *
 * SCOPE: only the manual BTN_B boost is hooked (racer.c:3623). The dash-pad boost 18 lines later
 * (racer.c:3641) arms the same `boostTimer` from the same `sInitialBoostTimer` and is left stock,
 * so that a behaviour change during testing is unambiguously attributable to one code path.
