/**
 * @file port/enhancements/events/GameEvents.h
 * @brief G-Diffuser gameplay event surface — the seam between the matching decomp and port/.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * decomp/ is a *matching* decompilation: every non-PORT build must stay byte-identical to the
 * retail ROM, so enhancement logic MUST NOT live there. Do not patch decomp/ to change gameplay.
 * Each hook point gets exactly ONE `#ifdef PORT` one-liner in decomp/ that announces "this
 * happened, here is the value I am about to use" — decomp/src/game/racer.c:3623 for OnBoostStart,
 * and racer.c:763, :1703, :5587 for the pre-existing frame-interpolation cut shims. The logic
 * lives in port/enhancements/ as a listener. Anything more is another decomp diff to rebase on
 * top of upstream inspectredc/fzerox.
 *
 * WHY LUS'S EVENT BUS RATHER THAN A PORT-LOCAL CALLBACK LIST
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * libultraship already ships a publish/subscribe bus (libultraship/src/ship/events/
 * EventSystem.cpp, C entry points in libultraship/src/libultraship/bridge/eventsbridge.cpp), and:
 *   - EventSystem::CallEvent (EventSystem.cpp:55) hands every listener a NON-const `IEvent*`
 *     pointing straight at the caller's stack payload, so a listener can write through a pointer
 *     field and change a live game value — exactly what an enhancement needs.
 *   - It is already reachable from C (eventsbridge.h), already inspectable at runtime (LUS's
 *     EventDebuggerWindow walks the registry and shows per-call-site hit counts), and already
 *     exported for .o2r script mods, so third-party mods get these hooks free.
 *
 * TRANSLATION-UNIT CONTRACT
 * -------------------------
 * DEFINE_EVENT (libultraship/include/ship/events/EventTypes.h:107) emits the payload struct plus
 * DECLARE_EVENT, whose meaning flips on INIT_EVENT_IDS:
 *   - INIT_EVENT_IDS defined  -> `extern "C" EventID OnBoostStartID = -1;`  (a DEFINITION)
 *   - INIT_EVENT_IDS undefined-> `API_EXPORT EventID OnBoostStartID;`       (a DECLARATION; per
 *     [dcl.link]/7 a declaration directly inside a linkage-specification is treated as `extern`)
 * So exactly ONE translation unit — GameEvents.cpp — may `#define INIT_EVENT_IDS` before including
 * this header. Every other includer gets plain declarations and links against those definitions.
 *
 * LISTENER PRIORITY — READ THIS BEFORE PICKING ONE
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * The engine's documented contract (EventTypes.h:12-20, SCRIPTING.md "Event Priority") says
 * EVENT_PRIORITY_HIGH listeners run FIRST. The implementation does the opposite:
 * EventSystem::RegisterListener (EventSystem.cpp:24-29) inserts with a `std::lower_bound` whose
 * comparator is `existing.Priority < toInsert.Priority`, keeping the vector sorted ASCENDING, and
 * CallEvent iterates front-to-back. Real dispatch order is LOW -> NORMAL -> HIGH, so for a mutable
 * payload the HIGHEST priority listener writes LAST and wins. Until that is fixed upstream, assume
 * "last writer wins" and prefer EVENT_PRIORITY_NORMAL.

 * @brief Fired the instant a racer's boost timer is (re)armed, before the game uses the value.

 * @param racerId `Racer::id` (decomp/include/unk_structs.h:170) of the machine that boosted.
 *                0..gNumPlayers-1 are human players; higher ids are CPU racers. A listener that
 *                only wants to affect the local player must check this — the fire site runs for
 *                every racer on the grid, CPU included.
 * @param frames  Pointer to the live `Racer::boostTimer` (unk_structs.h:232, `s32`) the game just
 *                wrote. A listener may overwrite `*frames`. Never null at the current fire site.
 *
 * Stock value is `sInitialBoostTimer` = 100 frames (decomp/src/game/racer.c:387). 100 is not just
 * a duration: racer.c:4455 compares `boostTimer` against `sInitialBoostTimer - 1` and
 * racer.c:4460/:6093 divide by `sInitialBoostTimer` to drive rumble strength and boost-flame
 * scale. Those read the *variable*, so a listener that rewrites only `*frames` leaves them
 * normalised against 100 — a longer boost keeps its visual/rumble ramp on the stock curve rather
 * than stretching it. Accepted cosmetic mismatch for a tuning knob.
 *
 * NOT cancellable — the fire site uses CALL_EVENT, not CALL_CANCELLABLE_EVENT. By the time it
 * fires, the sound-effect flag, shadow colour and energy gating are already committed by the
 * surrounding decomp branch, so `*frames = 1` is the closest honest equivalent to a cancel.
