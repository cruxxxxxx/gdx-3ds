//   * ROM  — the US-rev0 dump is VerifiedKnown; the Japan dump is ACCEPTED (AcceptedUnknownWarn with
//            `jpRom` set) for the experimental raw-ROM boot — setup then SKIPS archive extraction for
//            it. Any other hash is Rejected with the generic mismatch message.
//   * IPL  — each known dump (JP retail, US prototype) is labelled by region (VerifiedKnown); every
//            other correctly-sized dump is AcceptedUnknownWarn (accepted, but the caller must surface
//            the warning text visibly).
//   * disk — each known dump is labelled by region (VerifiedKnown); any other correctly-sized image is
//            AcceptedUnknownWarn. The size gate stays a hard reject inside ValidateDiskFile.
//
// JAPANESE-REGION GATE (CMake option GDX_ALLOW_JP_INPUTS, default OFF — see port/CMakeLists.txt).
// With the option OFF this function REJECTS Japanese game data at this validation layer, which is
// the single place the wizard, the drag & drop handler and the Browse… picker all funnel through:
//   * ROM  — the Japanese dump is Rejected by SHA-1, and ANY other image whose N64 header country
//            code is 'J' is Rejected too, so an uncatalogued Japanese dump is still named as
//            Japanese rather than reported as an unrecognised file.
//   * disk — the retail Japanese Expansion Kit disk is Rejected by SHA-1. Unrecognised images are
//            unaffected (a 64DD image carries no region marker that separates the fan-translated
//            disk from the Japanese one it was built from).
//   * IPL  — NOT gated in either state. The 64DD shipped only in Japan, so the JP retail dump IS the
//            canonical firmware, and it carries no game audio — refusing it would break every user
//            for no safety benefit.
// With the option ON, none of the refusals above apply.
